TODO List for Fiberized.IO
==========================

BUGS
----
* scheduler::add_thread caused problem
* Detach fiber doesn't work well with fiberize(...), as the std::{cin,cout,cerr} switch streambuf back when fiberized main exists.
  User must make sure that main fiber exists *after* all fibers using them.

Core
----

* Refine `FIBERIZED_MAIN` macro if we have to determin thread number before starting scheduler
* Complete `fibio::io::{udp, local_stream, local_datagram}`
* Make sure size-restricted stream can work (for HTTP reques/resqonse body reader and Redis client)
* Make sure `fibio::condition_variable` and `std::condition_variable` can be used to communicate between `fiber` and `not-a-fiber`
    * Make sure `not-a-fiber` can notify `fiber` via `fibio::condition_variable`
    * Make sure `fiber` can notify `not-a-fiber` via `std::condition_variable`
    * Make `concurrent_queue` work between `fiber` and `not-a-fiber`
* Shared mutex(RWLock)
* Barrier
* Future support
* Fiber constructor with variadic arguments
* Logging

Protocol
--------

* Test drive, start with a simple Redis client
* HTTP client
* HTTP server framework
    * Session store
